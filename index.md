# Introduction

I am a PhD student at the [Centre for Speech Technology Research (CSTR)](https://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/), School of Informatics, the University of Edinburgh, supervised by [Prof Peter Bell](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/pbell1/). 
My research interest lies in **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)**, especially **End-to-End ASR**. For more information, please refer to my [CV](https://zhaozeyu1995.github.io/pdf/cv.pdf) (updated 30 August 2024).
I am also a contributor of [SpeechBrain](https://speechbrain.github.io/).

# Recent Work and News

* (August 2024) One paper accepted in IEEE SLT Workshop 2024. See you in Macau!
* (August 2024) I submitted my PhD thesis in August and will start to work at Swansea University as a Research Officer in September.
* (March 2024) I am now working on a new [differentiable WFST-based ASR toolkit, named **BenNevis**,](https://github.com/ZhaoZeyu1995/BenNevis) where the topology can be freely defined.

# About my English name

Jarvis has a similar pronunciation to my Chinese name (Zeyu) and is short for Just A Rather Very Intelligent System, which is the speech assistant of Iron Man suit. It is a coincidence that I also major in Speech Recognition.
