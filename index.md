# Introduction

I am a PhD student in the [Centre for Speech Technology Research](https://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/), School of Informatics, the University of Edinburgh, supervised by [Peter Bell](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/pbell1/) and [Hiroshi Shimodaira](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/hshimoda/). 
My research interest lies in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), especially End-to-End ASR.
