# Introduction

I am a PhD student in the [Centre for Speech Technology Research](https://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/), School of Informatics, the University of Edinburgh, supervised by [Peter Bell](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/pbell1/) and [Hiroshi Shimodaira](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/hshimoda/). 
My research interest lies in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), especially End-to-End ASR. For more information, here is my [CV](https://zhaozeyu1995.github.io/pdf/cv.pdf) (updated 5 May 2023).

# About my English name

Jarvis has a similar pronunciation to my Chinese name (Zeyu) and is short for Just A Rather Very Intelligent System, which is the speech assistant of Iron Man suit. It is a coincidence that I also major in Speech Recognition.
